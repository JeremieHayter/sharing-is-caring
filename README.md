# sharing-is-caring
Looking to share is hope of improving my writing and learning something new.

Please note that these scripts assumes the following:
-You have an application in sccm with the same name to complete the check. 
-$SiteCode is set to your sccm site code.

In the future, if there is an interest, I might update these scripts to function even if there is no previous version to compare to so that it will just download the latest version.
